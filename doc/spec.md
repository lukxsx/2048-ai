# Project specification

## Information for university
- Bachelorâ€™s in computer science (CS)
- Known programming languages: C, C++, Java, Python
- Documentation language: English

## Project info
- Implementation of the 2048 game and an AI bot to play it automatically
- Using minimax algorithm for solving the game
- Create a game client with two options: user play or AI play
- Programming language: C
  - Unit tests using [Check](https://libcheck.github.io/check/), it should be already installed on university Linux systems, at least on Melkki
  - Test coverage using Codecov (online), coverage data created using gcov on GitHub Actions
  - I have made 2048 clone using C before, so I hope this won't be not too difficult. I can switch to Java if this ends up beign too difficult
