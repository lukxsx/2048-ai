# Project specification

## Information for university
- Bachelorâ€™s in computer science (CS)
- Known programming languages: C, C++, Java, Python
- Documentation language: English

## Project info
- Implementation of the 2048 game and an AI bot to play it automatically
- Using minimax algorithm for solving the game
- Also implementing two additional modes: randimizer AI mode and mode that
plays the game with randomized input for comparing the performance of minimax
- Compare the results of different modes
- Create a game client with options for user play or AI play
- Programming language: C
  - Unit tests using [Check](https://libcheck.github.io/check/), it should be already installed on university Linux systems, at least on Melkki
  - Test coverage using Codecov (online), coverage data created using gcov on GitHub Actions
- Expected time complexity: O(b^m) and space complexity: O(bm) (b = number of moves, m = maximum depth)
