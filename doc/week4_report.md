# Week 4
## 7.4.2022
I'm working with minimax AI. I created a helper function to check if a player
can move to specific direction. It works by making a copy of the game and
testing the move on it. If a move can be made, it returns true. It might not be
the best way to do that, because making copy of the game is a heavy process.

## 8.4.2022
Working on the minimax algorighm. There are some bugs but it's doing something.

## 9.4.2022
Refactoring the whole game.c file to make it easier to use with minimax AI.
This reduces a lot of complexity. This broke almost all of the test, so I have
to fix them.
